I am Tanjil Hasan Khan, presenting alongside Afra Anika and Aimaan Ahmed. 
So, lets dive into the topic and talk about why ethical considerations in military technology development is necessary..

Military technology drives innovation, aiming for national security and strategic superiority. From gunpowder to drones, these advancements have shaped history and will continue to do so.. However, as these technologies evolve ethical considerations become crucial.. We must ensure that the pursuit of military advancement is guided by proper ethical guidelines and prinicples to uphold human dignity and environment..

"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." This famous quote by Robert J. Oppenheimer, reflecting on the creation of the atomic bomb, comes from the Bhagavad Gita. Oppenheimer expressed his deep sense of responsibility and remorse over the devastating power he helped unleash. His quote highlights the moral debates around military technology. Oppenheimer’s regret contrasts with utilitarian arguments that justify such weapons for the greater good, prompting us to consider the long-term consequences of these technologies.

Let's quickly look at some historical examples of military oppression.

Unit 731, led by the Imperial Japanese Army during WWII, conducted horrific biochemical experiments on prisoners of war and civilians. 

The Auschwitz concentration camp saw brutal experiments on prisoners, where diseases like malaria and hepatitis were tested not on animals, but on humans.

The Manhattan Project, aimed at developing the first nuclear weapons during WWII, changed the course of the war and sparked the Cold War nuclear arms race, raising ethical questions about nuclear warfare.

“Agent Orange,” used by the U.S. during the Vietnam War, caused severe environmental damage and long-term health issues due to its dioxin content.

Stuxnet, a sophisticated computer worm discovered in 2010, targeted Iran's nuclear program, believed to be developed by the U.S. and Israel as a covert operation.

Other examples include the Operation Ranch Hand, the Srebrenica Massacre, and the Afghan War Diaries, all reflecting severe ethical breaches.

The Former Britain Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his 2019 speech at the UN General Assembly emphasized the need for ethical frameworks and international cooperation to handle the challenges posed by military technology. He highlighted the importance of technological revolutions and the ethical issues they bring, advocating for human oversight over machines to maintain humanitarian values.

Now, my friend Afra will take over from here.
