Agile modeling: collection of innovative, user centred approaches to system development

Prototyping: info gathering technique useful in seeking user reactions, suggestions, 	     innovations, revision plans, etc.

4 types of Prototyping: 
-Patched up 
-non operational
-first of a series
-selected features

Patched up
- has all features but inefficient
- user can interact w system
- retrieval and storage of info is inefficient

Non Operational
-nonworking scale model set up to test certain aspects of the design
-hard to prototype whole model.. so just test with input and output

First of a Series
-creating a pilot
-a full scale prototype is installed in one or two locations first, if success then duplicates are installed at all locations.. basically its a completely operational prototype

Selected Features
-some but not all essential features are included
-build in modules and is part of the actual system

Guidelines for Developing Prototyping
-Work in manageable modules
-Build the prototype rapidly
-Modify protoype in successive iterations
-Stress the user interface

Disadvantages of Prototyping
-can be difficult to manage prototyping in a large project
-users and analyst might adapt to the prototype as a working project

Advantages of Prototyping
-changing the system early in its development
-opportunity to stop dev on a system thats not working
-develop a system that more closely addresses users needs and expectations

Rapid Application Development(RAD)
-oop approach to systems development that includes a method of dev as well as software tools

RAD phases
-requirement planning 
-rad design workshop 
-implementation


SDLC
-identify oppurtunities and objectives
-determine information requirements(ER-D)
-analyze systems needs(DFD)
-design the recommended system
-develop and document the system
-test the system
-introduce the system


Values of Agile Modeling

-Communication 
-Simplicity 
-Feedback 
-Courage

Principles of Agile Modeling

-Satisfy customer through delivery of working software
-Embrace change
-Continue to deliver functioning software incrementally and frequently
-Encourage customers and analysts to work together
-Trust motivated individuals to get job done
-Promote face to face convo
-Concentrate on getting software to work
-encourage continuous sustainable development
-adopt agility w attention to mindful design
-provide rapid feedback
-encourage quality 
-adopt simplicity
-review and adjust behavior occasionally

Activities of Agile Modeling: Coding --> Testing --> Listening --> Designing

Resources of Agile Modeling: Time Cost Quality Scope

**4 Core Practices: 

-Short Releases
-40 hour work week
-Onsite Customer
-Pair programming

**Agile Development Process:

-Listen to user stories
-Draw workflow model
-create new stories based on model
-develop prototypes
-create physical data model using feedback from prototypes and workflow models


Scrum

-begin the project with a high level plan that can be changed on the FLY!
-success of the project most important ... individual success secondary
-project leader has some influence on the detail
-system team works within a strict time frame


Components of the scrum methodology:

-product backlog
-spring backlog
-sprint
-daily scrum
-demo
